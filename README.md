# Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study
## Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Captone Project

As a recent completer of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate programme, I actively applied the skills I learnt through working on a bike share project. 
The course imparted me with a solid foundation in a variety of technical tools: spreadsheets, SQL, BigQuery, Tableau and R. One is free to choose whatever tools which suits them to complete the project. 

I chose to work with SQL in a Postgresql database, and Tableau. 

#Context
I assume the role of a junior data analyst in a fictional company called Cyclistic, a bikeshare company based in Chicago.
The marketing director believes that we should focus on converting casual riders into annual members, instead of pushing out a campaign which targets all new-customers. 
I am tasked to use data analytics to answer the following question: *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*

The file named sql_code.sql contains my SQL queries, and you can view my written report on Medium [here](https://medium.com/@gmw172/google-data-analytics-professional-certificate-capstone-project-cyclistic-bike-share-case-study-8021d5d1b0b).

Thank you and have a nice read :)
